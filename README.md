# Smart-Campus-Timetabling-Resource-Allocation
The Smart Campus Timetabling System is a constraint-aware academic scheduling platform designed to generate conflict-free timetables using real-world rules and institutional constraints. Unlike static or manual timetable systems, this project implements an automated scheduling engine that enforces faculty availability, workload limits, room constraints, and batch-level rules.
The system is role-based, secure, and transactional, ensuring correctness and preventing silent scheduling conflicts.
